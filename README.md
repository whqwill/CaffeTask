# CaffeTask2

It is a HIWI job about object classification using Caffe, a Deep Learning Framework (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), with different CNN(convolutional neural networks) Models on the cifar100, and CUB200-2011(fine-grained classification) database at Pattern Recognition Group of RWTH-Aachen(http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/). 

The first task is normalizing images in CUB200-2011 database by geometry transformation (python script) and doing fine-grained classification using AlexNet. 

The second task is using GoogLeNet on cifar100 data with hierarchical model. I follow the algorithm from paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0736) with my own clustering algorithm (from confusion matrix) to do classification.
